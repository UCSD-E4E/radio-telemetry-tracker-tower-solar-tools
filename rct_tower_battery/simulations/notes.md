DC-DC converters are modelled as 25A current source. THIS IS A HUGE OVERESTIMATION! This load was assuming that each DC-DC converter was outputting its max current (around 7.5A) and the efficiency of the converter was ~50%. A more realistic max current can be gotten from summing the max input current of the Nucleo boards and the optoisolation cable, at ~70% efficiency, which gives 3-4A in the worst case, but I preferred to use the former method just to be safe. 

Simulation assumes that battery is running for a day, dropping by around 1 volt to 50% charge, before being swapped. At 86k seconds, the right battery is placed in parallel and the switch connecting the two is turned on. There is around 1000 seconds when both batteries are running, in parallel, which is very unrealistic as they would normally be in parallel for about a minute at most, but did this amount of time to be safe. After this, the left switch is turned off, switch to only the right battery.

Simulation shows that leakage current of these diodes is very good, even after running for a day, as there was only 1uA of leakage during the 10 minutes they were in parallel. Diodes that were used were RB238T-40NZ schottky diodes.
